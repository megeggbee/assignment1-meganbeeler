<br><hr /><br> General About Me: <br><br>
I am in my third year at The Mount, and just in a small period of time I have experienced many things! 
Beginning in August of 2023, I have been in the MSJ Concert Band in which I play the Flute, Piccolo, and on occassion, the Clarinet.

<br>
I have attended many club and group meetings, but I found the most interest in the MSJ Residence Hall Council. 
After being a general member for a year and a half, I was elected to the President position. 
Following my rise to Presidency, RHC has doubled in size and has become an organization that is well known for its monthly Bingos and low-stress commitment to its members!

<br>When I am not busy with school and RHC, I enjoy spending time with my family, friends and most of all, my dog, Buttercup. 
During breaks, I travel with my family to national parks and other fun places!
